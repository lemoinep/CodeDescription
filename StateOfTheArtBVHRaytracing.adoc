*Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)*

*Ray Tracing across GPU & CPU*
[.text-justify]
Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) and ray tracing are pivotal techniques
in the realm of computer graphics, particularly when it comes to
rendering realistic images. BVH acts as a spatial data structure that
optimizes the ray tracing process by organizing geometric objects into a
hierarchy of bounding volumes. This means that instead of checking every
individual object for intersection with rays, the algorithm can quickly
eliminate large groups of objects that don’t intersect with the ray’s
path. This hierarchical approach significantly reduces computation
times, allowing for more complex scenes to be rendered efficiently.
[.text-justify]
On the other hand, executing ray tracing on CPUs versus GPUs presents
different advantages and challenges. CPUs excel in tasks requiring high
single-threaded performance and complex computations, making them
suitable for detailed simulations or intricate calculations where
precision is paramount. However, they tend to struggle with parallel
processing due to their limited cores compared to GPUs. In contrast,
GPUs are designed for highly parallelizable tasks, making them ideal for
performing extensive ray tracing operations simultaneously across
multiple pixels.
[.text-justify]
Ultimately, the choice between using BVH with CPU or GPU-based ray
tracing hinges on specific project requirements. For real-time
applications like video games where speed is essential, GPU-accelerated
ray tracing combined with BVH can deliver stunning visuals without
compromising performance. Conversely, for offline rendering tasks or
situations demanding higher quality outputs where time is not as
critical, leveraging CPUs might be more advantageous.
[.text-justify]
The current landscape of ray tracing and BVH techniques is rapidly
evolving, with significant advancements in both hardware and software
across various platforms, including AMD GPUs, NVIDIA's CUDA
architecture, and CPU implementations. We present also a comprehensive
overview of the state of ray tracing and BVH techniques as of 2024.

*1. Ray Tracing Overview*
[.text-justify]
Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the way light
interacts with objects to produce highly realistic images. The basic
algorithm involves casting primary rays from the camera and then
calculating intersections with objects in the scene. For each
intersection, secondary rays can be generated (reflection, refraction,
etc.) to simulate optical effects. The performance of ray tracing
depends on the quality of the acceleration structure (like BVH) and the
intersection algorithms used. BVH is a key technique for accelerating
ray tracing, and research continues to improve these algorithms for
optimal performance. With advancements in GPU technology, real-time ray
tracing has become feasible, allowing for enhanced visual fidelity in
applications ranging from video games to architectural visualization.

*2. Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)*
[.text-justify]
Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) algorithms play a role in the realm of
graphics and computer animation. These algorithms optimize the
performance of ray tracing and other rendering methods by structuring
the objects in a scene into a data format. Typically organized as an
n-ary tree, with nodes linked to bounding volumes such as boxes and
leaves containing lists of primitives such as triangles. The efficiency
of BVH tree construction depends on the number of triangular facets
included in each bounding volume. Various domain specific strategies and
programming approaches have been suggested to enhance ray traversal and
intersection functions in BVH. A significant advantage of BVH algorithms
lies in their ability to manage scenes containing objects. By arranging
the scene BVH algorithms can swiftly navigate through the scene.
Pinpoint relevant objects without needing to test each object
individually for intersections. This characteristic makes BVH algorithms
indispensable for real time rendering tasks like video games and
interactive visualizations. Moreover these algorithms are adaptable. Can
be fine tuned for hardware setups like GPUs and CPUs. The parallel
assembly of bounding volume hierarchy (BVH), on GPUs is currently an
area of exploration.

*2.1 Some key points regarding BVH performance in parallel programming
and on GPU*
[.text-justify]
Building the BVH on GPU aims to speed up the process of creating the BVH
structure used in ray tracing and other applications. Modern GPUs offer
great parallel computing power, making them well suited to building BVH.
Several parallel approaches have been proposed, including the use of
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) to accelerate construction
[1]. Using methods such as sorting objects based on their Morton Code
(traversal order) can improve the performance of building BVH on GPU.
[.text-justify]
*Linear BVH (LBVH):* The Linear Bounding Volume Hierarchy (LBVH), or
linear bounding volume hierarchy, is a promising approach for the
parallel construction of BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy).The most
promising approach for parallel BVH construction is the use of an LBVH
(Linear BVH). LBVH simplifies the problem by first choosing the order in
which the leaf nodes (corresponding to each object) appear in the tree,
then generating the internal nodes so as to respect this order . This
method makes it possible to efficiently exploit the parallel computing
power of GPUs. The main advantages of LBVH is faster to construct than
other surface area heuristic (SAH)-based methods. It can handle dynamic
scenes (where objects move) by recycling the same BVH with incremental
updates but the quality of BVH generated by LBVH may be lower than that
of SAH builders. This can lead to less effective collision and ray
tests, especially when objects overlap or have complex shapes.
[.text-justify]
*Dynamic scenes and recycling of the BVH:* In dynamic scenes (where
objects are moving), it is common to recycle the same BVH at each
simulation step. We only recalculate the bounding boxes of the nodes
based on the new positions of the objects, while preserving the
hierarchical structure of the nodes. However, these algorithms can run
into problems when the tree deteriorates unpredictably over time. When
objects move (dynamic scene), the LBVH can update the existing BVH
without completely rebuilding it. When an object moves, the LBVH updates
the relevant nodes in the tree. This saves calculation time compared to
a complete reconstruction. The LBVH reuses the initial BVH, updating it
as the scene changes. This approach is more efficient than
reconstructing the BVH at each frame. Although the LBVH can update the
BVH incrementally, it cannot handle all types of changes. For example,
if an object radically changes shape, the BVH may require a complete
reconstruction.

*2.2 Alternatives techniques*
[.text-justify]
*GBVH (Grid-induced Boundary Volume Hierarchy):* The GBVH only updates
the modified part of the scene. It recalculates the node bounding boxes
based on the new object positions, while retaining the existing
hierarchical structure (10). How it works. The GBVH divides the stage
space into a regular grid. Each grid cell contains a group of objects.
This grid allows you to quickly locate objects in space. When the GBVH
is first constructed, the objects are distributed among the grid cells.
Each cell becomes a node of the GBVH. When objects move, the GBVH
updates only the affected cells. It recalculates the bounding boxes of
the affected nodes. The main advantages is that GBVH reduces the initial
construction cost compared to LBVH. It is effective for dynamic scenes
with frequent movements.
[.text-justify]
*OLBVH* (Octree Linear Bounding Volume Hierarchy): OLBVH is used for GPU
acceleration of direct volume rendering and interior-exterior
intersection testing on volumetric meshes. It's octree-based data
structure is laid out linearly in memory using Morton curves. BVH for
volumetric meshes, for example tetrahedral meshes used in finite element
simulations, must have different characteristics to achieve high
performance. The OLBVH, a linear BVH based on the Morton curve for
volumetric meshes that produces memory efficient trees in a time
efficient manner. Heuristics used during construction are controlled by
parameters, allowing faster construction and a reduced memory footprint
by generating shallower trees. The OLBVH is a versatile acceleration
framework for volumetric meshes.
[.text-justify]
*PLOC* (Parallel locally ordered clustering Parallel locally ordered
clustering): Meister and Bittner [19] is a parallel bottom-up
construction algorithm based on agglomerative clustering. The algorithm
starts from the individual triangles by considering them as clusters.
Then, in each iteration, it merges multiple cluster pairs in parallel,
repeating this until only one cluster remains, which corresponds to the
root node. The algorithm employs the Morton curve to find the nearest
neighbors efficiently
[.text-justify]
*TRBVH* (Treelet restructuring Treelet restructuring): is a parallel
optimization method that improves the quality of an existing BVH Karras
and Aila [20]. The algorithm starts from the leaves and proceeds up to
the root until a given treelet size is reached. Then, the treelets are
restructured in order to locally minimize the BVH cost induced by a
particular treelet. After the treelet is restructured, the algorithm
continues one level above and repeats the process. To avoid race
conditions, a node is only processed by the second thread (in the case
of binary BVHs) using atomic counters to be sure that both children were
already processed. Karras and Aila [20] restructured the treelet in an
optimal way regarding the cost function using a dynamic programming
approach. Later, Domingues and Pedrini [21] showed that better results
could be achieved using agglomerative clustering (agglomerative treelet
restructuring, ATR-BVH), which is simple and thus allows for
restructuring large treelets. This approach provides BVHs of very good
quality in reasonable times.
[.text-justify]
*Kd-trees:* Similarly to BVHs we build SAH kd-trees using 32 splitting
plane candidates in each node evenly distributed along the x, y, z
extents of its axis-aligned bounding box. Given the axis-aligned
bounding box of an interior node, the splitting plane candidates are
distributed the same way as for the BVH. Unlike for the BVHs, when all
triangles fall into one child of a node, an empty leaf is created for
the other child. The kd-trees are built with split clipping to get high
quality trees. With split clipping enabled a triangle is only considered
to fall into a child if it intersects its bounding box. These auxiliary
bounding boxes are then used for more precise triangle-child
intersection tests. We implement split clipping by directly computing
the intersection of each triangle with the bounding boxes of the
children of the currently subdivided node. Akenine-Mo"ller [22]

*3 The key benefits of using (BVHs) in real-time ray tracing
applications*
[.text-justify]
Efficient Ray Traversal: BVHs allow for very fast traversal of rays
through a complex 3D scene. By organizing objects into a hierarchical
structure of bounding volumes, the number of intersection tests required
is significantly reduced, enabling real-time performance.
[.text-justify]
* *Handling Dynamic Scenes:* BVHs can be efficiently updated when
objects in the scene move or deform, allowing real-time ray tracing of
dynamic environments. Techniques like BVH refitting and rebuilding
enable the acceleration structure to be quickly adapted to scene
changes.
* *Parallelization:* The hierarchical nature of BVHs makes them
well-suited for parallel processing on multi-core CPUs and GPUs. The
independent traversal of different parts of the BVH can be easily
parallelized, further boosting performance.
* *Simplicity and Generality:* Compared to other acceleration
structures, BVHs are relatively simple to implement and maintain. They
make few assumptions about the underlying scene, allowing them to be
used for a wide range of ray tracing applications, including path
tracing, photon mapping, and more [23][25].
* *Memory Efficiency:* BVHs can be stored in a compact, memory-efficient
format, which is important for real-time applications that need to fit
the entire scene in GPU memory [27].
* *Optimizations:* Numerous optimization techniques have been developed
for BVHs, such as the Surface Area Heuristic (SAH) for construction,
ordered traversal, and binned BVH building, which further improve their
performance [24][25].

*4. AMD's Ray Tracing Architecture*
[.text-justify]
AMD has made significant strides in ray tracing capabilities with its
RDNA architectures (RDNA 2 and RDNA 3). Ray Accelerators: Integrated
into the compute units to enhance ray tracing performance without
dedicated RT cores. Intersection Test Instructions: Specialized
instructions added to texture units enable efficient ray-object
intersection calculations, improving overall throughput. Deep BVH
Structures: RDNA architectures utilize deep BVH with multiple
subdivisions to optimize memory usage and reduce intersection test
throughput demands[1][3].
[.text-justify]
Concerning performance improvements a recent developments indicate that
AMD is working on enhancing ray tracing performance through neural
networks, which could lead to up to 1.5x faster ray tracing capabilities
in future architectures like RDNA 5[2]. Current RDNA 3 GPUs have shown
improved performance but still lag behind NVIDIA's dedicated RT cores in
certain scenarios[4].

*5. NVIDIA's CUDA Architecture*
[.text-justify]
NVIDIA has been at the forefront of ray tracing technology since the
introduction of its RTX series with dedicated RT cores. The architecture
utilizes: a dedicated RT Cores, specialized hardware designed to
accelerate ray-triangle intersection tests and a high throughput. the
Ampere architecture doubles the ray-triangle intersection test rate
compared to previous generations, allowing for more complex scenes to be
rendered efficiently[3].

Techniques Used:
[.text-justify]
* Inline vs. Indirect Ray Tracing: NVIDIA supports both methods through
its DirectX Raytracing (DXR) API. Inline ray tracing combines traversal
and shading into a single shader program, while indirect ray tracing
separates these tasks into different shaders[3].
* Adaptive Sampling Techniques: These methods dynamically adjust the
number of rays cast based on scene complexity or variance in pixel color
values. Areas with high detail receive more rays, while simpler areas
receive fewer, optimizing rendering time without sacrificing quality.

*6. CPU Implementations*
[.text-justify]
While GPUs dominate real-time ray tracing, CPUs are still relevant for
offline rendering applications where higher precision is required.
Techniques include:
[.text-justify]
* Monte Carlo Ray Tracing: A probabilistic method used for rendering
complex scenes by simulating light paths.
* Adaptive Sampling: Dynamically adjusting the number of rays cast based
on scene complexity to optimize rendering times.
* Hybrid Rendering Techniques: Combining rasterization with ray tracing
allows developers to leverage the strengths of both methods. For
example, rasterization can handle primary visibility while ray tracing
can be used for reflections and shadows.

*7. Current Challenges*

Despite advancements, several challenges remain in the realm of ray
tracing:
[.text-justify]
* Performance Overhead: Ray tracing can significantly impact frame rates
due to its computational intensity.
* Memory Latency: Both AMD and NVIDIA architectures face challenges
related to cache and memory latency during BVH traversal[3][4].
* Integration with Rasterization: Balancing traditional rasterization
techniques with ray tracing remains a key focus for developers.

*8. Solar Shading and Ray Tracing*
[.text-justify]
Solar shading algorithms with ray tracing are a powerful tool for
optimizing building design and energy efficiency. Through the use of
advanced computer simulations, these algorithms can accurately model the
way sunlight interacts with a building's structure, allowing architects
and engineers to predict and mitigate the effects of solar heat gain. At
the heart of these algorithms is the process of ray tracing, which
involves simulating the paths of individual light rays as they bounce
and refract through a virtual 3D model of a building. By tracking the
behavior of these rays, the software can determine precisely how much
solar radiation is entering the building at any given time, and make
adjustments to the design to reduce unwanted heat transfer. The benefits
of using solar shading algorithms with ray tracing are numerous. Not
only can they help to lower a building's energy consumption and
associated costs, but they can also improve occupant comfort by
regulating indoor temperatures and reducing glare. Additionally, these
tools can be used to explore a wide range of design options, allowing
architects to find the most optimal solution for a given project.

*9. Future Directions*
[.text-justify]
Looking ahead, both AMD and NVIDIA are expected to continue improving
their ray tracing technologies. AMD's RDNA 5 Architecture: Anticipated
improvements in ray tracing performance through architectural
enhancements and deeper integration of neural network techniques[1][2].
NVIDIA's Next Generation: Expected advancements in dedicated RT cores
and further optimizations for real-time applications.

(...)

*Conclusion*
[.text-justify]
In summary, the hierarchical structure, efficient traversal, and ability
to handle dynamic scenes make BVHs a crucial component in enabling
real-time ray tracing on modern hardware, powering advanced rendering
techniques in games, visual effects, and other interactive applications.
Building BVH on GPU is an active research area, and parallel approaches
such as LBVH have shown promising performance. LBVH is an effective
approach for parallel BVH construction, especially for dynamic scenes.
It optimizes performance while minimizing build time. LBVH is effective
for dynamic scenes, but these limitations must be taken into account.
Other approaches, such as adaptive BVHs, may be more appropriate for
certain situations. Le GBVH uses a spatial grid to organize objects and
handles updates incrementally. This helps optimize performance while
taking into account changes in the scene.

The state of BVH and ray tracing continues to evolve rapidly across AMD,
NVIDIA, and CPU platforms. While AMD has made notable progress with its
RDNA architectures, it still faces challenges in matching NVIDIA's
performance levels in certain scenarios. As both companies push forward
with new technologies and optimizations, the future of real-time ray
tracing looks promising, with enhanced realism set to become
increasingly accessible in gaming and professional applications alike.
